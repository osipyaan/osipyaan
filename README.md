## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Elena Osipyan! I am a 3rd year student @ University of Toronto Scarborough.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a supportive LLM tool for immigrant breast cancer patients, assisting NeuroTech UofT in their ML research for Parkinson's Disease tremor detection, and creating radiofrequency MRI pulse simulations for Near Lab @ Sunnybrook.

ðŸŒ± Trying to learn more statistics and always looking for resources :) 

ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on healthtech/biomedical engineering projects!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: studying physics/physical sciences @ UTSC
